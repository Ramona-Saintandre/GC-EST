// OBJECTS/ARRAYS EXERCISE 1
// Skills: Objects, arrays, and loops
// Create an array of 3 characters. Each character is an object with two properties--name and
// health. Create an object outside the array in a variable called opponent. The opponent also has
// name and health properties. (the opponent should start with more health than any of the
// characters.)
// Create a loop that:
// ● Prints out the name and health of all three characters plus the opponent.
// ● Prompts the user to pick a character by number (1, 2, or 3).
// ● “Battles” the selected character against the opponent. Remove five health from both
// the character and the opponent. (Or you can remove a random number from each.)
// ● Exit the loop when the user response is null, which means that the cancel button was
// clicked.
// Extended Challenges: 1) Do not allow a character with zero or less health to engage in battle.
// 2) Check for invalid input (must be number between 1 and 3). 3) Automatically end the
// program when the opponent health hits zero or all of the characters’ health has hit zero.
// Display a “win” or “lose” message.
