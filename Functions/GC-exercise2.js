// FUNCTIONS EXERCISE 2
// Skills: Hoisting / Scope / Closures / IIFE’s
// 1 Dimensional:
// A character can move forward and backward along a tightrope. They start at position 0, facing
// the positive direction and can move in the positive and the negative directions. They can also
// change direction. Use variables to keep track of their position and direction. Then define the
// following functions:
// ● moveForward: takes a distance parameter. Move the character forward (based on the
// direction they are facing) the specified distance.
// ● moveBackward: takes a distance parameter. Move the character backward (based on
// the direction they are facing) the specified distance.
// ● turnAround: reverse the direction the character is facing.
// ● printLocation: logs the current position to the console.
// Call the functions in the following order and check the results:
// 1. moveForward 5
// 2. moveBackward 3
// 3. printLocation … should print 2
// 4. turnAround
// 5. moveForward 10
// 6. moveBackward 5
// 7. printLocation … should print -3
// Wrap the whole program in an IIFE.
// Extended Challenge 2 Dimensional:
// A character can move around a map in two dimensions. They start at position 0 North, 0 East,
// facing north and can move in any of the four cardinal directions. They can also change
// direction. Use variables to keep track of their position and direction. Then define the following
// functions:
// ● moveForward: takes a distance parameter. Move the character forward (based on the
// direction they are facing) the specified distance.
// ● moveBackward: takes a distance parameter. Move the character backward (based on
// the direction they are facing) the specified distance.
// ● turnLeft: change the direction by 90 degrees to the left.
// ● turnRight: change the direction by 90 degrees to the right.
// ● printLocation: logs the current position (N and E) to the console.
// Call the functions in the following order and check the results:
// 1. moveForward 5
// 2. turnRight
// 3. moveForward 2
// 4. printLocation … should print 5 N, 2 E
// 5. turnLeft
// 6. turnLeft
// 7. moveForward 7
// 8. turnRight
// 9. moveBackward 3
// 10. printLocation … should print 2 N, -5 E
// Wrap the whole program in an IIFE
