// LOOPS EXERCISE 1
// Skills: Conditions and loops
// Counting Loops:
// Use a for loop to log numbers from 1 to 10, then another for loop to count down, logging
// numbers from 10 to 1.


    for( i = 0; <= 10; i++){
        console.log(i);
    }



// Repeat the exercise with a while loop.
// Repeat with a do while.
// Create this array: const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Use a for … of to loop through
// this array and log all the numbers. (Note: we’re not asking you to also count down on this one.)
// Extended Challenges second exercise:
// Given any string, use a loop to add padding (extra spaces) to the front to make the string ten
// characters long. For example, given the string “planet”, log “ planet” (add four spaces), and for
// the string “headlamp”, log “ headlamp” (add two spaces).

// Create a loop that runs through each item in the fruits array.


var fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];
for (x 
 
) {
  console.log(x);
}
